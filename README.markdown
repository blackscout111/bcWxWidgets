README: bcWxWidgets
===================
This folder contains wxPython modules that I find useful when writing gui
applications with wxPython.

Feel free to use this code!  Please just reference me in the code that uses this
as "Bryan A. Clifford".  Email me with any questions/comments/constructive
feedback at "blackscout111@gmail.com".
